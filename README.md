# A-B-Testing-for-E-Commerce-Webpage-Conversion-Enhancement
This project involved A/B testing in an e-commerce setting to evaluate the impact of a new webpage design on conversion rates. Analyzing over 290K user sessions, I compared the old and new designs using Z-score and P-value calculations. Results showed no statistically significant improvement, leading to a data-driven decision to retain the design.
